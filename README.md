# Introduction to Bioinformatics 
Introduction to Bioinformatics using Python and R. 


A. Overview
Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data, in particular when the data sets are large and complex. As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, information and data engineering, mathematics and statistics to analyze and interpret the biological data. Bioinformatics includes biological studies that use computer programming as part of their methodology, as well as specific analysis pipelines that are repeatedly utilized, particularly in the scope of genomics. Common uses of bioinformatics include the identification of candidate genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). 

The following tutorial provides guidance through varied bioinformatics analysis, from raw, unadultered data to clean results. It additionally shows you how to import and evaluate your data and how to report it. The following features are employed:
  * Employ Bioconductor to determine differential expressions in RNA-seq data. 
  * Run SAMtools and develop pipelines to find single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and Indels.
  * Use ggplot to create and annotate a range of visualizations.
  * Query external databases with Ensembl to find functional genomics information.
  * Execute large-scale multiple sequence alignment with DECIPHER to perform comparative genomics.
  * Use d3.js and Plotly to create dynamic and interactive web graphics.
  * Use k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines and random forests to find groups and classify data.
